# HomeWizard API

This is a sinatra webserver based on the `server.rb` file I found in the [HomeWizard](http://www.homewizard.nl/) iPhone application. This probably indicates what calls can be made to the HomeWizard device.

## So far

At this point I only have a list of calls you (probably) can make an what kind of (json) data will be returned. As soon as I've purchased a [HomeWizard](http://www.homewizard.nl/) myself I will try to transform this into a real API so you can control your HomeWizard within you own code.
